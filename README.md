"Excited to share my latest projectâ€”a real-time character counter! 
ðŸš€ Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool dynamically counts characters and prevents input when the limit is exceeded. 
A great way to enhance user experience by maintaining text limits efficiently. Always learning and growing! ðŸ’»âœ¨"

Feel free to tweak it as needed!
